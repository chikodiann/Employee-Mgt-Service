# Employee Management System (Microservices Architecture)

This project is a RESTful Employee Management System designed using Spring Boot microservices. It handles user authentication, employee and department management, with proper security, documentation, testing, and Docker orchestration.

---

## 📦 Microservices Overview

| Service           | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Discovery Server | Registers and discovers all services via Eureka              |
| Config Server    | Central config management for all services                   |
| API Gateway      | Routes requests and applies global security filters          |
| Auth Service     | Handles login, registration, JWT issuance, and RBAC          |
| Employee Service | Manages employee and department CRUD operations              |

## 📜 API Documentation

Each service includes Swagger (OpenAPI) for endpoint documentation:
```
http://localhost:{PORT}/swagger-ui.html
```

---

## 📘 Assumptions

- Only authenticated users can access APIs.
- Admin has full access.
- Manager can view department employees.
- Employees can view only their profiles.

---

## 🧠 Architecture Decisions

- Adopted microservices to ensure separation of concerns.
- Used Spring Cloud for service discovery and routing.
- Externalized configuration using Spring Cloud Config.
- Applied JWT and role-based access for secure access control.
